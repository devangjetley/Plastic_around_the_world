Project Overview:
This project presents an in-depth analysis of plastic waste generated globally, utilizing Microsoft Excel for data processing and visualization. The focus is on understanding the current state of plastic waste, its sources, recycling rates.

Research Questions:
Q1) What is the total plastic waste (in metric tons) generated by all countries?
Q2) Which country has the highest total plastic waste, and what is the amount?
Q3) What is the average recycling rate across all countries?
Q4) What are the most common main sources of plastic waste across different countries? How many countries fall under each category?
Q5) Which five countries have the highest recycling rates?
Q6) What are the most common coastal waste risks? How many countries fall under each category?
Q7) What is the average per capita plastic waste (in kilograms) across all countries in the dataset?

Key Insights:
The analysis covers several critical aspects of plastic waste, including
•	Total Plastic Waste Generated Globally: An estimation of the total metric tons (MT) of plastic waste produced by all countries.
•	Country with the Highest Total Plastic Waste: Identification of the country contributing the most to global plastic waste and the specific amount.
•	Average Recycling Rate Across Countries: A look into how effectively countries are recycling their plastic waste.
•	Common Sources of Plastic Waste: Exploration of the primary sources contributing to plastic waste across different nations and categorization of countries under each source.
•	Top Five Countries with Highest Recycling Rates: An analysis of which countries excel in recycling practices.
•	Coastal Waste Risks: Examination of the most prevalent risks associated with coastal plastic waste and categorization by affected countries.
•	Average Per Capita Plastic Waste: Calculation of average plastic waste generated per person across all countries in the dataset.

Tool Used:
•	Microsoft Excel: For data analysis, visualization, and reporting.

Conclusion:
This project aims to shed light on the pressing issue of plastic waste management worldwide. By analyzing these insights, we can better understand the challenges we face and explore potential solutions for a more sustainable future.
